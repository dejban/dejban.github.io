		<h3>"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!"</h3>
		<h4>July 5, 2017</h4>
		<p>Richard Feynman tells the story of his adventurous life from childhood to the years after his Nobel prize. Apart from his genius, you will learn a lot about his childish honesty, persistence in learning (whether it is physics, music, drawing, or a new language), intuitive problem solving, humility, and of course sense of humor. The most important thing I learned from his autobiography is his first principle thinking or skepticism towards the "experts" as he mentions: "... I never pay any attention to anything by experts. I calculate everything myself."</p>
